# Turtle Art Day

## What is Turtle Art?

Every child can place puzzle blocks together. 
In a Turtle Art program, the blocks tell a turtle to move about on screen and to draw lines and arcs in different colors.
a sequence of blocks is code that describes a piece of art. 

Some blocks can create pattersn by repeating sequences of other blocks, or can make logical decisions.
This kind of programming is inspired by the LOGO programming language, that was designed in the 1970s to be easy enough for kids and powerful enough for all ages to have fun. 
While creating art, we learn about geometry and programming.

Turtle Art is used by many people in the world, especially in countries where schools use the [Sugar Learning Platform](http://www.sugarlabs.org).
